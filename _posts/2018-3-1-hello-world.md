I've decided to blog! Some reasons for this in no particular order:

* <s> looks good on a resume </s>
* ~Express Myself~ 
* Get feedback on my perspectives
* Solidify my experiences
* Live a more intentional and reflective life
* Journal my challenges
* Document personal growth
* Become a better writer (opportunities to write as a CS student are limited at best)
