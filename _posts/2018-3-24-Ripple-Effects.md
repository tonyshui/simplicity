The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914 triggered WWI. WWI propelled the U.S. forward as the leading power and creditor in the world as European countries sunk into debt and monarchies crumbled. Most historians agree that the losses suffered and harsh conditions post-WWI contributed to an atmosphere of bitterness that allowed the rise of the Nazi Party and the start of WW2. The balance of power after WW2 led to the Cold War, and the ensuing space race.

Although each link in a chain of events may not be directly responsible for the next, it's mind-boggling to think that the assassination of a single person potentially contributed to the United States placing a man on the moon decades later.

# What is the Ripple Effect

> Ripple Effect - the continuing and spreading results of an event or action.

The ripple effect can refer to large historical events that affect a global impact like the example above. On the other end of the spectrum, the ripple effect can refer to me having to pull an all-nighter to make up 7 lectures before a midterm because I consistently talk myself out of taking the 15-minute bus ride to attend class and that procrastination adds up.

The ripple effect isn't a novel idea - most people are aware of it. But I decided to draw special attention to this phenomenom because of something inexplicably fortuitous that happened to me during spring break this year.

# My crazy experience

After 5 days of soaking in good Cancún vibes (video coming soon), I was ready to head home and gear up for the imminent academic onslaught as classes resumed. Sitting down in the airplane, I started to grab my noise-cancelling headphones as I mentally prepared for the hours of movies and TV shows I was eager to consume through the personal screens built into the seats. To my left sat my friend Alex, who I went on vacation with. 

A quick glance to my right revealed a strangely familiar middle-aged Asian man. I did a double-take. And a triple-take. And a quadruple take for good measure. It was [Dr. Cong Shi][1], my Statistics Professor from the Industrial & Operations Engineering department last semester. A quick exchange of hellos led to one of the best conversations I've ever had. For the entire duration of the flight, we shared stories, perspectives, and advice. I learned about Cong's online gaming days during his college days in Singapore where he was ranked globally in the MMORPG DoTA, his study-abroad experience at UC Berkeley where he had to use a shovel to stir a giant vat full of baked beans when cooking for his 40-person housing cooperative, his decision to pursue his Ph.D at MIT following a brief stint at Citi Sales and Trading, and his weekly trips with his wife and kids to Shangri-La and Hong Hua, two savory Chinese restaurants in Metro Detroit that I frequent all the time as well.

The ripple effect of me taking his stats course led me to recognize him on the plane and engage in conversation. From this encounter, I've started to build a strong relationship with Cong. We're connected on WeChat (Chinese Social Media) - yeah, we are *that* serious. Just last week, we caught up for the first time since the flight over some lunch at Fireside Café at Pierpont Commons and we've already planned our next lunch. 

# Reflection

What were the odds of this entire encounter though? We both had to have gone to Cancún, leave on the same flight, AND sit in the same row. On top of that, I had to have taken his class before or else I wouldn't have recognized him as anyone but a middle-aged Asian man.

Gotta say, Cong is a damn cool guy, and I wouldn't have known any better if the circumstances had been any less perfect. Which makes me think. So many events in life are on a whim. As much as we can try to plan out every action to take, there are so many unaccountable factors that it doesn't even make sense to try and plan everything down to a tee. 

For example, take my college experience so far. I've met close friends because we lived in the same dorm (Markley) and the surrounding Hill dormitories. I've met other close friends solely because we happened to sit next to each other in class. And yes, one of the most unique relationships I've formed came from recognizing a professor on an airplane. My dormmates, classmates, and fellow passengers are not under my control, which reiterates my point that sometimes the best things in life are just by chance.

# Lesson learned

Now, what would a blog post be without some preachy advice? Here it is:

**Some interactions in life are unexpected but good for you. Embrace them. Maximize positive encounters to extend the ripple effect.**

Just because life is unpredictable doesn't mean you shouldn't set specific short-term and long-term goals that you consistently work at. Having purposeful goals gives oneself a perspective on how to approach the unexpected and turn it into something beneficial. Just give yourself some breathing room to react and adapt to the unpredictability.
