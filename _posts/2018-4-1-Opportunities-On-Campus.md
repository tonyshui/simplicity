title               : "Opportunities On Campus"

The University of Michigan is host to a variety of job opportunities for its students. Some students may choose to work in the dining halls, where they can improve skills in interpersonal communications, team dynamics, dependality, and time management while getting paid (also free meals!!).

Other students might get paid doing research in a lab with a professor. Student-researchers can gain valuable skills, get a leg up on graduate school, and also contribute knowledge and impact the world!

Dining halls and research are just two student employment opportunities of many on campus. One in particular, EECS Instruction Aide, is a position that I hope to obtain in the *near* future (hopefully) because I believe that one of the best jobs, if not the best, is being an EECS IA - and here's why.

# The Perks of Being an IA

From the perspective of someone who has never been an IA, it seems that there aren't too many jobs that can compete in terms of experience, impact/fulfillment, and reward.

IA's hone their interpersonal communication skills, having to explain often difficult-to-grasp concepts to students. This skill is highly valuable, because while there is demand for good communicators, there is even higher demand for good communicators who can deeply understand technical concepts and are able to convey them to others. EECS IA's also get to host their own discussion section. They are personally responsible for the learning of an entire classroom, which is already a larger impact than students usually have on campus.

# What IA's have done for me

It would not be a long shot to say that I could just as easily been studying something besides computer science. I took ENGR101 (Intro Programming) and EECS280 (Programming and Intermediate Data Structures) because I was lost in Engineering. I took programming courses because my parents said the high job demand made it the best option.

My EECS280 and EECS281 IA's were arguably the most influential in helping me enjoy computer science. While EECS Professors are super knowledgeable, its often difficult to create a personal relationship with them because of the sheer student to faculty ratio. I was able to receive more one-on-one time with my IA's when I needed help, and they were the ones who really made it fun for me. 

The opportunity to 'pay it forward' and inspire proactive learning into students, like my previous IA's did for me, would be an opportunity that I would love to have.
