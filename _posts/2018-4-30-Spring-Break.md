# Our Travels

My friend Alex and I stayed a week at the Grand Oasis Cancun, a resort in the Zona Hotelera. While we could have just stayed on resort, our vacation package included a smart car that we *most definitely* utilized. Whipping the two-seater across the Yucatan Peninsula, we made a stop at **Tulum**, an ancient Mayan port city with well-preserved ruins. We also took a ferry to **Isla Mujeres**, where we drove around on a golf cart the entire day.

We then took the smart car to **Riviera Maya**, where we met up with our friend Jashan. **Cozumel**, a ferry ride across from Riviera Maya, was our best stop.  Considering the lack of seat belts, lifeless dashboard, and fumes of burning rubber, there was no shot the Jeep Wrangler we rented in Cozumel was street legal. However, minus not knowing if we had enough gas, Cozumel was paradise. 

Gunning the stick-shift down a stretch of ocean-side road, the Caribbean breeze gusting through the open-top, the sun’s rays hitting the atmosphere to create a purplish sky … these were some *phenomenal vibes*. In addition, we were on island time. For those who don’t know, lateness is completely acceptable and the norm on island time. We returned two vehicles a collective 3 hours late and the owners were chill about it.

All in all, fantastic vacation 10/10 would recommend. Only thing I would do differently would be to visit a [cenote][1]. Other notable events included us getting pulled over by the cops, our nightlife experiences, and also the [plane ride back from Mexico][2]! Might write about the first two, we’ll see…

# Video Editing Process + Announcement!

I brought my DJI Mavic Pro drone, and Alex brought his EOS Rebel T5i DSLR and GoPro Hero 5 with Karma Grip. I used Final Cut Pro X to edit the footage, and the song I used is [Guarijon 808 by Kansado][3] (shoutout Stone Zhang for the recommendation).

I plan on vlogging/blogging in NYC, where I’ll be interning this summer. I'm not sure how comfortable I am filming in public, but I think vlogging is dope so I'm going to take a crack at it.

Note: If you personally know vloggers, please connect us! I could definitely use some tips.
