5 months ago, after reading a persuasive <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/5-reasons-listen-podcasts" target="_blank">article</a>, I reached out to my LinkedIn network for podcast recommendations because I felt I could improve my productivity during certain times of the day.

It worked out decently because I got some awesome recommendations that I've ingrained into my weekly school routine. You see, engineering classes at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor are located on North Campus, a 20 minute commute from Central Campus. 20 minutes doesn't seem that bad until you realize how much it adds up.

Time for some quick maths:

40 minute round trip to North Campus x 3 trips per week (on average) x 4 weeks per month x 7 months per school year = 3360 minutes, or 56 hours just spent COMMUTINGðŸšŽ. Of course, with my class-skipping habit, this rough estimate is no doubt overshot, but let's just pretend I'm a decent student... ðŸ˜…

Sometimes, it's nice to have those 40 minutes to myself, bump the latest bopðŸŽ§, meditate, or converse with commuting friendsðŸ—£. But at the same time, 56 *choice expletive* hours. 56!!! I could listen to over 300 10-minute podcasts ranging from <a href="https://player.fm/series/tedtalks-audio/how-we-can-turn-the-cold-of-outer-space-into-a-renewable-resource-aaswath-raman" target="_blank">how we can turn outer space into a renewable resource</a> to <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-stupid-obsession-lawns/" target="_blank">why our obsession with lawns is downright stupid</a>. I highly recommend trying out podcasts if you haven't already, as there is something for virtually anyone. You can squeeze in some extra learning, get a motivational high-five to start your day, listen to comedy podcasts for laughs, or audiobooks (not really podcasts) too if you find that's your kind of thing.

**Here's a list of 9 Free, Informative, and Engaging Podcasts that I love listening to (in no particular order):**


1. Freakonomics Radio
2. Ted Talks Daily
3. Personal Best
4. Hidden Brain
5. How I Built This
6. Invisibilia
7. Tim Ferris Show
8. WSJ - The Future of Everything
9. Unchained
