From time to time, I hear a quote and I think DAMN and then I forget about it. Or I'll write it down in some notes or scribble it down somewhere on my iPad. Point is, it'd be nice to have a single place where I can log some dope quotes that I am impacted by. Some you might find interesting. Others might not make sense without context.
