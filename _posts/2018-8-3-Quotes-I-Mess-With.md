From time to time, I hear a brilliant quote, and promptly forget it. Sometimes I'll write it down in some notes or scribble it down somewhere on my iPad. It'd be nice to have a single place where I can log some awe-inspiring quotes that I come across. Some you might find interesting. Others might not make sense without context...
